# City-Weather
This is simple android application dispalying the weather basde on the searched city. The application enables you to to customize a list of previously searched cities. By default, the weather information of the first city in the list would be displayed on the main page of application.



## Instalation

Either use Android Studio (http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html), or build from the command line: ./gradlew build

## Scope

The weather informaiton of each city in this version of the application doesn't include the wind speed and direction. 


## Version

1.0

## Future work

In the next version of application, I would like to include the complementary information provided by the REST API in this application. It would also be interesting to include the "Weather history" and "Forcast weather" provided by other REST APIs available at apixu.com. 

I also think we can improve the UI lifecycle by utilizing ViewModel found at (https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) .
